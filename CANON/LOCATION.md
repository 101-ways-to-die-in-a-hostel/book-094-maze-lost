**Where exactly does the death occur?**

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Hassan
**Description:** 50s Moroccan man, gentle, speaks five languages, knows every corner of the main building. Inherited this job from his father.
**Role in death:** Warned Kyle about the layout, offered tour, was ignored. Devastated when Kyle is found.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Fatima | Elderly, mutters about "the old parts" being unlucky |
| Security | None | N/A |
| Bar/Kitchen | Youssef | Young, makes excellent breakfast, told Kyle not to wander at night |
| Manager | Hassan (same) | Owner and operator |

### Staff Knowledge
Hassan knows the building is a maze. He doesn't know the abandoned wing is accessible. Fatima knows more than she says - local superstitions about the sealed wing. No one expects anyone to actually find their way into the death zone.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Relaxed, beautiful. Travelers lounging in courtyard, sipping mint tea. The chaos of the medina outside, but peace within these walls. A genuine oasis.

### Night Vibe
Magical. Candlelit, quiet conversations on roof terrace. The building feels ancient and protective. Unless you wander. Then it feels ancient and indifferent.

### Guest Demographics
Mix - cultural tourists, backpackers, some older travelers attracted to the history. International (French, British, American, Japanese common).

### Reputation
Online reviews: "Stunning riad, like stepping back in time" "Got lost finding the bathroom LOL but worth it" "Hassan is wonderful" "The architecture is incredible" "Bit of a maze but adds to the charm"

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Taxi can only reach the edge of the medina. Walking through narrow streets required. Easy to hire a guide from the gate. Kyle refused.

### Check-in Process
Warm welcome, mint tea, brief tour offered (Kyle declined), shown to room personally.

### Rules
Quiet hours after 11 PM, shoes off inside, no alcohol in common areas. No explicit warning about wandering because no one expects the issue.

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: good in courtyard, spotty in rooms)
- [x] Kitchen (breakfast included)
- [x] Lockers
- [ ] Laundry (nearby service)
- [ ] Pool
- [ ] Bar
- [x] Rooftop (terrace with medina views)
- [x] Tours offered (cooking classes, medina tours, tannery visits)
- [x] Other: Hammam (steam bath) on site

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Fes medina is genuinely labyrinthine - one of the most complex urban environments in the world. Getting lost is common but usually just annoying. Abandoned sections of riads do exist.

### Cultural Sensitivity
Morocco is a Muslim country - respect for religion, dress codes, local customs required. Don't make the architecture a villain - it's cultural heritage. The danger comes from Kyle's arrogance, not Moroccan design.

### Sources
- Fes medina architecture studies
- UNESCO World Heritage documentation
- Backpacker accounts of riad stays
- Medical literature on dehydration in enclosed spaces
